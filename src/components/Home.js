      Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
      as opposed to using Content here, content here, making it look like
      readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors
      now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for lorem
      will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have
      evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
      (injected humour and the like).`}

      has been the industry standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
      unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
      specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
      into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
      popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
      Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
      like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.`}
